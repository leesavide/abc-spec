How to install abcpp
--------------------

1. Linux and other Unices
-------------------------

Login as root, unpack the archive, and type

  # make; make install

This will install abcpp in /usr/local/bin, and its support files in
/usr/share/abcpp.

On Red Hat and derivatives, you can build an .rpm for abcpp with this
command:

  # rpm -ta abcpp-x.y.z.tar.gz
  
Then find out where the .rpm was created, and install it as usual:
  
  # rpm -i abcpp-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm


2. Windows
----------

Get the binary package and unpack it. Copy ABCPP.EXE to a directory
included in the PATH. Confused? C:\WINDOWS will do. Make a new folder
called C:\ABCPP and copy all .ABP files therein.

Done!
