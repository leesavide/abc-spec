TRANSLATIONS
------------

To make a translation of this guide into other languages, you will need
to:

  - translate the file abcplus_en.tex, renaming it to indicate the new
  language (e.g. abcplus_fr.tex). In the title, add "... translation by
  ...". Beware of references to localised figures, see next point;
  
  - translate all figures that have '_en' in their file name, and change
  the suffix. For example, annotations_en.abc --> annotations_fr.abc
  
  - translate all appropriate entries in the Makefile.

  - this guide is released under the GNU FDL, so you must make the source
  available. Please send it to me for public release.

Your translation will be put online on http://abcplus.sourceforge.net, and
you will be given full credit.

Thank you!
